# Principles-of-Programming-Languages

These are the projects that I wrote during the Principle of Programming Languages class at Rutgers University in OCaml, Lambda Calculus, Prolog and Python languages. 


Topics:
BNF and context free grammars; Data visibility (i.e., lexical and dynamic scoping);  Procedures and  parameter passing techniques; Types, type checking and type equivalence; Functional programming paradigm: higher-order functions, recursive data structures, programming with recursion (i.e., without iteration);  Logic programming paradigm:  unification, generate and test.
